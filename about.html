      <h1>About This Project</h1>

      <p>
        This website is made for a small challenge between some friends that takes place
        on the Rift during the 2026 ranked season.
      </p>

      <p><strong>The challenge rules are simple:</strong></p>

      <ol>
        <li>Only EUW and EUNE accounts are allowed.</li>
        <li>You are not allowed to Duo with a friend during this challenge (3% of games will be allowed).</li>
        <li>You are the only one allowed to play ranked on the accounts you register
            (account sharing will get you disqualified).</li>
        <li>
          The main reason for this challenge is to have fun and for everyone to reach ranks
          higher than their peak.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Because not all participants are in the same rank or skill level, the leaderboard
        shows who has reached their peak rank and beyond.
      </p>

      <p>
        The winner will be the person who gets further away from their peak rank.
        <br><br>
        Example:
        <br>
        If your peak rank is <strong>Diamond III 22 LP</strong> and you reach
        <strong>Master 50 LP</strong>, you will have <strong>328 points</strong>.
        <br>
        If another player's peak rank was <strong>Gold IV 45 LP</strong> and they reach
        <strong>Emerald III 50 LP</strong>, they will have <strong>905 points</strong>,
        meaning they get a higher placement.
      </p>

      <p>
        Negative points mean you are below your peak rank.
        <br>
        <strong>1 point = 1 LP away</strong> in either direction.
      </p>

      <p class="about-signature">
        Good luck and have fun.
        <br>
        See you on the Rift,
        <br>
